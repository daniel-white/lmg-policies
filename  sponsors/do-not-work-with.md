## Do Not Work With

### Drugs / Alcohol

- We do not believe this is responsible for us to promote at this time.

### Crypto / NFT’s / ICO’s

- Many of our team members believe crypto has long-term potential, but the market is largely unregulated and flooded with scams and people/groups with your worst interest in mind. This is not a field we want to get mixed up in at this time.

### Credit Loans

- Large life decisions like taking out loans is not between us and our audience. We are not financial advisors. We have worked with banks in the past who offer these types of services, but we want to avoid promoting them directly at this time.

### Drop Shipping as a Service

- “Drop shipping” simply means listing an item that is available from another source. There’s nothing inherently wrong with a retailer listing a product that’s in stock at their supplier’s warehouse… HOWEVER there is a growing industry that offers to help individuals set up their own drop shipping business with basically no standards for the quality of the service and products.
- After our initial fact-finding, we worked with one of these companies in 2023, but based on community feedback we don’t plan to again.

### Gaming Chairs that don’t prioritize ergonomics

- The market is oversaturated, and only continues to be flooded with low quality lookalikes. We will continue to use our discretion when entering into partnerships with chair companies and closely monitor our community’s feedback.

### Mental Health/Therapy

- We are pro therapy and advise anyone reading this to prioritize their mental health. With that being said, we would hate for someone's mental health to be negatively impacted by a bad experience with a service that we promoted. We do not intend to promote any companies who profit from these services at this time.

### Online Sport Betting

- We do not believe this is responsible for us to promote at this time.

### Gambling (More Broadly)

- We do not believe this is responsible for us to promote at this time.

### Pay-2-Win Games

- Many free to play games can be predatory. We test mobile games to see if that game can be enjoyed without the NEED to sink money into it. We know this is a fine line, but with our community’s feedback we believe we can separate the bad from the ones that are safe for partnership.

  - Eg. Diablo Immortal (On Launch) = Bad. Genshin Impact = Not Bad

### Unproven Kickstarters / Indiegogo Campaigns

- We’ve simply seen too many issues with false promises and delivery issues from first-time campaigners. We DO, however, understand that for some companies crowd funding is more of a marketing and demand-evaluation exercise, so we have worked with companies who have had successful campaigns or product launches in the past and our intention is to continue doing so.

### VPNs

- We used to partner with Private Internet Access, but they, among others, were acquired by a single holding company, leading to concerns about privacy and data. While we acknowledge the usefulness of VPNs and many members of our team use them - including PIA -  it’s hard for us to PUBLICLY back any specific VPNs given the fluidity of the landscape. Our intention is to just stay out of it for now.
