# lmg-policies

This repo is a POC for Linus Media Group to consider for tracking changes of policies and procedures.

These files are written in Markdown and can be viewed in a browser or in a text editor. A static site generator can be used to create a website from these files.

I am happy to transfer ownership of this repo to LMG if they wish to use it as a community tool or even delete it upon request.

As a first light touch step to provide an example, I have imported [Colton's post](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1527945-lmg-sponsor-do-not-work-with-list/) from the LTT Forum thread into the `sponsors` folder. I only converted to markdown, added a header.

I look forward to all feedback!
